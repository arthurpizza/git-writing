# Git and Markdown for Writing

## Getting the tools

Depending on your operating system installing git and your favorite text editor will be different. Here are some tricks.

Some of the tools you might want:

* git
* vim (or neovim)
* aspell
* pandoc
* Calibre
* rsync

By using vim (or neovim) you can make your writing experience as sparce as possible.

__Windows__

To install Git and Vim into Powershell you need to install [Chocolatety]. This will let you grab native Windows builds and keep them up to date.

[Ninite] is a great download tool for applications like [Atom] and [Notepad++] which both have excellent support for Markdown.

__OS X__

[Brew] is your one stop shop for all the best commandline tools for OS X.

__Linux__

If you're using a Linux based distrobution Git and Vim will be in most default package managers. Support for NeoVim and Atom might very. In my experience I was able to get NeoVim in Manjaro and Atom on every x86 based Linux distro I've used.
